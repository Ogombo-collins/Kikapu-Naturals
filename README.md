# Building investor‑grade metrics and insights for Kikapu Naturals, a consumer packaged goods company scaling D2C and B2B growth

**Goal**: Delivering retention, LTV, and funnel dashboards/visuals or insights for Kikapu Naturals, a CPG brand preparing to raise capital — complete with reconciled datasets, a data dictionary, and an investor‑ready executive summary.

## Context (Simulated Task- Not real-life):
We’re looking for an experienced Data Scientist / Analytics Engineer to help Kikapu Naturals prepare for a fundraise deliver a small set of core business metrics.
The business operates in Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) and Subscription SaaS, serving both D2C customers (individual consumers) and B2B clients (retailers, distributors, and enterprise accounts).  D2C Customers are about 50,000, while B2B clients are about 200. 
The goal is to calculate, validate, and present metrics that leadership and investors can trust.
This is a short-term, fixed-price project with clear deliverables and a tight timeline. Results must be delivered in Looker, so they can be reused and tracked over time.

**Scope of Work**

You will be responsible for delivering:
1. Retention and cohort analysis: Monthly cohorts of D2C customers (≈50,000 active users) and B2B accounts (≈200 clients).
2. LTV calculations: Including Net LTV (revenue minus COGS and discounts), across ~10 consumer packaged products.
3. Funnel analysis: Tracking acquisition → activation → conversion → repeat purchase.

The underlying data exists but is spread across multiple systems (Shopify, Stripe, Salesforce CRM, and internal product databases). This work will involve querying, joining, and validating data before presenting results.
